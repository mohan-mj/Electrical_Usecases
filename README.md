[Electrical Fault detection and classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/esathyaprakash/electrical-fault-detection-and-classification):

The transmission line is the most crucial part of the power system. The requirement of power and its allegiance has grown up exponentially over the modern era, and the prominent role of a transmission line is to transmit electric power from the source area to the distribution network. The electrical power system consists of so many complex dynamic and interacting elements that are always prone to disturbance or an electrical fault.
High-capacity electrical generating power plants and the grid concept, i.e., synchronized electrical power plants and geographical d displaced grids, required fault detection and operation of protection equipment in minimum possible time to remain stable. The faults on electrical power system transmission lines are supposed to be first detected and classified correctly and should be cleared in the least possible time. The protection system used for a transmission line can also initiate the other relays to protect the power system from outages. An exemplary fault detection system provides a practical, reliable, fast, and secure way of a relaying operation. The application of pattern recognition technology could help discriminate against faulty and healthy electrical power systems. It also enables us to differentiate among three phases of a three-phase power system experiencing a fault.

[Li-ion Battery Aging Datasets](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/Li-ion-Battery-Aging-Datasets/uj5r-zjdb):
This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah). <br>

[Identifying the Physics Behind an Electric Motor](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hankelea/system-identification-of-an-electric-motor)
The data set comprises several sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) deployed on a test bench. This PMSM represents a traction drive from a german manufacturer. Test bench measurements were collected by the LEA department at Paderborn University.

The most important aspect of an electric vehicle from a marketing and engineering perspective is its efficiency and, thus, achievable range.
For this, it is essential to avoid over-dimensioning of the drive train, i.e. applying more and heavier metal packs to increase its thermal capabilities.
If the motor is controlled inefficiently through the inverter, there'll be superfluous power losses, i.e. heat build-up, which eventually leads to electric power derating during operation and, crucially, early depletion of the battery.

Efficient control can be achieved only if the dynamic behavior of the drive train is accurately known by the control algorithm.
The task of the controller is to achieve a desired torque at the vehicle's wheels by controlling the currents of the electric motor via the applied voltages.
The most interesting task here is hence to be able to accurately predict the currents for a given switching command (also called element vector).

[Inverter Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stender/inverter-data-set)
The data set comprises several sensor data collected from a typical combined system between an inverter, an induction motor, and a control system, deployed on a test bench.
Test bench measurements were collected by the LEA department at Paderborn University.

An inverter is a power electronic component with transistors (read 'switches'), that determine how the battery voltage (so called DC-link voltage) is applied on the three phase circuits of the electric motor.
The control unit decides according to some control strategy the current switching states of the inverter at each discrete point in time.
